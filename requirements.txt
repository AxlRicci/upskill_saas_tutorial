-- what page do you present choices?
* User should see link for basic plan on home page.
* User should see link for pro plan on home page.
-- How will app know user choice when registering?
* Basic plan link should point to regular devise sign up form.

Stripe integration
* Users should have a stripe customer token in the users table.
* Javascript should prevent pro form from submitting, when user fills it out
and should send card info to stripe.
* Javascript should send user fields and card token to our rails app. Rails app
should validate the user fields. Rails app will not whether user is signing up
for plan 1 or plan 2.
* Once validated, rails should send user info (email, plan id) and card token
to stripe server and stripe will create a subscription and send back customer
token. Rails should save customer token and user information to our database.
